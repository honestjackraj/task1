                  Q1 Write a difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2.
                     
                      *HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is standard for communication on world wide web since its invention in 1989
 
                            HTTP 1.1                                                     HTTP 2
                
                      * Developed by Timothy berners lee                        * Developed by Google
                      
                      * It must take multiple TCP connections                   * It simply establishes single connection object
                        to lessen the effect of HOL blocking                      between two machines 
               
                      * Syntax and semantics are seperated                      * Addition of server push function
               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
                  Q2 Write a blog about objects and its internal reprsentation in javascript.
    
                      * Objects in javascript is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern js

                      * Object in javascript is quite differnet from javascript primitive datatypes

                      * While primitive datatype can store single datatype and Object can save many types of primitive datatype as well as primitive data types

                      * objects always come with key-value pair

                      * var myCar = new Object();
                        myCar.make = "Ford";
                        myCar.model = "Mustang";
                        myCar.year = 1969;
                           
                                #unassigned properties of the object is undefined and not null

                        myCar.color; ie unassigned.
                                                                        ##############################
